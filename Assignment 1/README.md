# Question 1
One large chemical company pays its salespeople on a commission basis.  The  salespeople  receive  $200  per  week  plus  9%  of  their  gross  sales  for  that  week.  For  example, a salesperson who sells $5000 worth of chemicals in a week receives $200 plus 9% of $5000, or a total of $650. Develop a program that will input each salesperson’s gross sales for last week and will calculate and display that salesperson’s earnings. Process one salesperson's figures at a time.

### Sample Output 

Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): 5000.00

Salary is: $650.00

Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): 1234.56

Salary is: $311.11

Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): -1

# Question 2
The process of finding the largest number (i.e., the maximum of a group of numbers) is used frequently in computer applications. For example, a program that determines the winner of a sales contest would input the number of units sold by each salesperson. The salesperson who sells the most units wins the contest. Write a pseudo code program and then a program that inputs a series of 10 non-negative numbers and determines and prints the largest of the numbers.
